🛠️ Tech Stack & Learning Environment
All SQL analysis in this repository was executed using SkilloVilla’s Interactive SQL Workbench. 
This environment allowed me to practice industry-standard data querying within a cloud-based relational database management system (RDBMS).

Platform: SkilloVilla SQL Workbench.

Database Dialect: PostgreSQL / MySQL (as supported by the SkilloVilla terminal).

Database Schemas: * Northwind Traders: A classic ERP database containing 12 tables including Suppliers, Customers, Orders, and Products.

AirlineDB: A complex aviation database focusing on flight segments, bookings, and seating logistics.

Methodology: * Interpreted Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams to map complex table relationships.

Wrote and optimized queries to solve specific business problems provided by the platform.

Validated results against SkilloVilla's testing suites to ensure 100% data accuracy.
